Made for the ["Eurecom Kart" Robot Project](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/apvrille/OS/projects_fall2021.html) of the [Operating Systems](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/apvrille/OS/index.html) course at Eurecom.

The V1 is made for time attack without any opponent on the circuit.

The V2 is made for racing against an opponent, the objective is to use A* pathfinding algorithm coupled with some scanning of the area to know where to go with the shortest path.
