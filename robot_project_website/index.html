                  <h4>Architecture of the robot</h4>
                  <p>The robot is 15 cm * 28 cm. It has two driving wheels. Each wheel has its own motor. The robot also uses a small metal ball that serves both as a third wheel and counter weight. It uses a sonar, which is also controlled by its own motor.</p>
                  <p>The robot has access to a map of the circuit, which contains information about the walls and the obstacles. Then it uses an algorithm called A* to determine rapidly the path it  must take to do a tour.
                    <p>The sonar, located at the front of the robot, allows the robot to spot obstacles, which might either be other robots or physical/static obstacles. When the robot spots a new obstacle, it updates its map of the circuit.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>The robot is able to determine its position in the circuit thanks to motor control of both wheels. Its position is defined by two numbers x and y, as well as its orientation or direction in the stadium (which is an angle).</p>

                  <h4>Algorithms used</h4>
                  <h4> First algorithm : Race without opponents </h4>

                  <p> We create a map of the stadium and divide it into 6 zones called UP_RIGHT, UP_LEFT, MIDDLE_RIGHT etc… The robot knows the zone it starts in (generally the starting point of the stadium). Then, the robot is programmed to behave differently according to the zone it is in. To orient itself in the zone, it uses both the sonar and the gyroscope. It does not use the compass since it is not reliable due to the working environment(the lab). The robot knows when it changes zones, and its behavior changes. </p>
                    <P> For example, when the robot is in zone MIDDLE_LEFT, it must go straight forward to access UP_LEFT. If the gyro angle states that the robot is not going in the right direction (aka the gyro angle is not in the predefined interval), then the robot turns left or right. When the robot detects that it is close enough to the wall, thanks to the sonar, it knows it has reached the UP_LEFT zone.</p>
                      <h4> Second algorithm : with opponents, A*</h4>
                      <p>The robot has access to a map of the circuit, which contains information about the walls and the obstacles. Then it uses an algorithm called A* to determine rapidly the path it  must take to do a tour.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The robot has access to a map of the circuit, which contains information about the walls and the obstacles. Then it uses an algorithm called A* to determine rapidly the path it  must take to do a tour.
                  </p>
                  <p>We give a robot a starting point and a destination. By using these, the A* algorithm finds the shortest (or close to)  path. How does the algorithm works? At each step, it choses the “closest” node to move to, until the destination is reached. But how do we define “closest”? 
                  </p>
                  <p>To find the next node, the algorithm calculates the sum of two things :
                  </p>
                  <p> -the length of the path between the starting point and the node 
                  </p>
                  <p>-the length of the path between the node and the destination
                  </p>

                  <p> Then the algorithm chooses the node that has the smallest sum of lengths. The above lengths of course are not exact because there can be new obstacles etc but since we don’t need a perfect precision the algorithm works just fine.

        <h4> Source code and work organization</h4>
        <p> We each wrote pieces of the source code, which can be find in details on our gitlab : </p>
        <p><a href="https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/fournipi/os-robot-project.git"></a></p>
        <p> Our git contains all the important information about the code, how to compile it and run it.</p>
        <p> We tried to work as much as possible as a group to debug and test the code, via zoom and in the lab.</p>
